### My repo
The repository contains some of my work that I have done since March 2020. 

#### Pogba or Modric
The idea was that Pogba was a more effective player at the offensive side of the game. I compared his shot assists with Modric's.
The quality measure that I paid regard while comparing their shot assists was the xG that the shot pass creates. 
The visualization shows Pogba had much less shot assits compared to Modric during the WC 2018, as he was tasked to play as a deep lying playmaker.
However, it can be easily seen that the rare chances that Pogba creates had much higher quality in general, compared to those created by Modric.

#### The xP Index
The aim was deriving a pass quality metric. I used a sample of 50.000 passes from Premier League and created an expected pass model by logistic regresson.
When a probability of being successful for each pass is calculated, then it was easy to see what players exceed the expectations in terms of pass completion. 
After creating the metric, not surprisingly, the outcome is highly correlated with the pass accuracy in general.
But I focused on the top right corner of pass accuracy vs the xP index plot, to identify elite passers, only among midfielders. 
Then I increased my focus into who exceeds expectations in terms of the xP index level given their pass accuracies. 
I noted these players down as potentially very effective passers who manage to create successful pass attempts under tougher situations.
